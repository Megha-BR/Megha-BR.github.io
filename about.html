            <p>I'm a happy-go-lucky gal. A cancerian by birth, I love to make friends. Being a hard-working person, I do not like
                to easily give up on things. I love to call myself a TV buff. I can spend hours watching movies and sitcoms. All I would need
                is a pack of chips with my favorite dip.
